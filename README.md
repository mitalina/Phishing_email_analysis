# Phishing_email_analysis
In this project, I conducted an analysis of email phishing attempts occurring in the real world today. This analysis is crucial as it helps identify and mitigate threats posed by malicious actors. By scrutinizing these phishing attempts, we can better understand the tactics used by attackers and develop more effective strategies for combating such threats.
### Objective: Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

### Tools: Email client or saved email file (text), free online header analyzer.

### Examples of Poor Grammar and Spelling in Phishing Emails:

### Bad Grammer:

"If exceeded it limit." 
Sentences might be grammatically incorrect, like using the wrong tense or subject-verb agreement. 

### Awkward Language:

Phishing emails often use language that sounds unnatural, forced or threat, like "Your mailbox will be suspended." 

### Typos:

Typos are common in phishing emails, often indicating the sender is not a native English speaker or is rushing to send the email. 

## Summarize phishing traits found in the email.
 ### phishing traits:
1. Generic Greetings: Legitimate companies typically address you by name or use a personalized greeting. Phishing emails often use "Dear Customer," "Dear Sir/Madam," or other impersonal greetings. 
2. Urgency and Threats: They may claim your account is compromised, payment is overdue, or you need to act immediately to avoid penalties. 
3. Poor Spelling and Grammar: While some sophisticated phishing emails might avoid this, many contain typos, grammatical errors, or awkward phrasing. 
4. Suspicious Links and URLs: Hovering over a link might reveal a different URL than what is displayed, or the URL itself may be misspelled or look suspicious. 
5. Requesting Personal Information: They often ask for sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, or social security numbers. 
6. Generic Content: The email content might seem generic, unrelated to your specific situation, or sound too good to be true. 
7. Suspicious Attachments: Be wary of opening any attachments, especially unexpected ones, as they may contain malware. 
8. Mismatched Sender Information: The sender's address or logo might not match the rest of the email or company signature
